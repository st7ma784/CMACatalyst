# Debt Relief Information Manual

## Section 1: Debt Relief Orders

A Debt Relief Order (DRO) is a court order that provides relief from certain debts. It's an alternative to bankruptcy or an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) for people with a low level of debt.

### Eligibility for DRO

To be eligible for a Debt Relief Order:
- Total unsecured debts must not exceed £15,000
- Disposable income must not exceed £50 per month
- You must not own a property
- You must have lived or worked in England or Wales for the last 3 years

### Debts Included in DRO

The following debts can be included:
- Credit cards and store cards
- Personal loans
- Overdrafts
- Payday loans
- Rent arrears
- Council tax arrears
- Gas and electricity arrears

### Debts NOT Included in DRO

The following debts cannot be included:
- Student loans
- Mortgage or secured loans
- Child support payments
- Criminal fines
- Court-ordered compensation

### Duration of DRO

A Debt Relief Order lasts for 12 months. After this period:
- The order is revoked
- You are no longer subject to restrictions
- Most debts are written off

### Cost of DRO

The court fee for a DRO is currently £90. You may be able to get a fee waiver if you cannot afford this.

## Section 2: Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVA)

An Individual Voluntary Arrangement is a formal agreement between you and your creditors to pay off your debts over an agreed period.

### Key Features of IVA

- Typically lasts 5-6 years
- You make regular monthly payments
- Interest is usually frozen
- Unsecured debts are included
- Provides legal protection from creditors

### Entering an IVA

1. Meet with an insolvency practitioner
2. Complete a financial statement
3. The practitioner submits a proposal to creditors
4. Creditors vote on the proposal
5. If approved by 75% (by debt value), it becomes binding on all creditors

### Advantages of IVA

- Avoids bankruptcy
- Prevents creditor action
- Debts are written off after the IVA term
- Keeps details of the agreement confidential
- Allows you to retain assets

## Section 3: Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is a legal process to deal with debts you cannot pay.

### Automatic Discharge

Since April 2004, the automatic discharge period is 12 months from the date you are adjudged bankrupt. However, this may be extended if:
- You have failed to cooperate with the trustee
- You have undisclosed assets
- Your income is higher than anticipated

### Assets in Bankruptcy

The following assets may be affected:
- Bank accounts and savings
- Property
- Vehicles
- Investments and shares
- Valuable personal items

Exempt assets typically include:
- Household items for personal use
- Clothing
- Tools of trade up to £1,500
- Car up to £1,500 value

### Bankruptcy Restrictions

During the bankruptcy period, you may be restricted from:
- Acting as a director of a company
- Working in certain professions
- Managing a business
- Using credit without disclosure

## Section 4: Income and Asset Considerations

### Income Thresholds

For low-income relief options:
- DRO: Disposable income max £50/month
- IVA: Typically requires disposable income to support the arrangement
- Bankruptcy: No income threshold, but trustee may seek contributions

### Asset Thresholds

- DRO: Must not own a property
- IVA: Usually must declare all assets; no specific threshold
- Bankruptcy: All assets over £1,000 may be available to trustee

## Section 5: Time to Resolution

| Option | Duration | Typical Timeline |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| DRO | 12 months | 2-4 weeks to court hearing |
| IVA | 5-6 years | 4-8 weeks to implementation |
| Bankruptcy | 12 months+ | 4-12 weeks to discharge |

## Section 6: Credit Record Impact

All three options affect your credit record:
- DRO: Shows for 6 years from start date
- IVA: Shows for 6 years from start date
- Bankruptcy: Shows for 6 years from discharge date

After these periods, the information is removed from your credit file.

## Section 7: Professional Fees

| Option | Typical Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| DRO | £90 court fee |
| IVA | Usually covered by creditors (no upfront cost) |
| Bankruptcy | £130 court fee; may increase based on assets |
