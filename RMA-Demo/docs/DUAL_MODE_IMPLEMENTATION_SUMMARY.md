# Eligibility Checker - Dual Mode Implementation Summary

## ✅ What We Built

### **Dual Mode Operation**
The Eligibility Checker now supports TWO operational modes in a single unified interface:

#### Mode 1: 📝 Manual Input (Hypothetical)
- **Use Case**: "Ask the Manuals" tab - hypothetical scenarios
- **How**: User types in debt/income/assets values manually
- **Example**: "What if someone has £51,000 debt?"
- **Best For**: Quick what-if analysis, consultation scenarios

#### Mode 2: 👤 Client Documents (RAG)
- **Use Case**: "Client Document Search" tab - real assessments
- **How**: System extracts values from uploaded client documents using symbolic reasoning
- **Example**: "Is CLIENT123 eligible for a DRO?"
- **Best For**: Formal client eligibility assessments

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Pydantic Model (`app.py` lines 98-108)
```python
class EligibilityRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str
    debt: Optional[float] = None
    income: Optional[float] = None
    assets: Optional[float] = None
    client_id: Optional[str] = None  # NEW: For client document extraction
    topic: str = "dro_eligibility"
    model: str = "llama3.2"
    include_diagram: bool = False
```

#### 2. Enhanced Endpoint (`app.py` lines 2173-2331)
```python
@app.post("/eligibility-check", response_model=EligibilityResponse)
async def check_eligibility(request: EligibilityRequest):
    """
    Dual-mode eligibility check:
    - Mode 1: Manual input (provide debt/income/assets)
    - Mode 2: Client documents (provide client_id)
    """
    
    # Mode detection
    if request.client_id:
        # Extract from client documents using symbolic reasoning
        client_vectorstore = rag_service.client_vectorstores[request.client_id]
        results = client_vectorstore.query(...)
        
        symbolic_result = rag_service.symbolic_reasoning.extract_and_compute(...)
        client_values = parse_symbolic_result(symbolic_result)
    else:
        # Use provided manual values
        client_values = {
            'debt': request.debt,
            'income': request.income,
            'assets': request.assets
        }
    
    # Same eligibility check for both modes
    result = rag_service.integrated_eligibility_check(...)
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Mode Selector (`EligibilityChecker.tsx`)
```typescript
const [mode, setMode] = useState<'manual' | 'client'>('manual');
const [clients, setClients] = useState<Array<{client_id, client_name}>>([]);

// Mode toggle buttons
<button onClick={() => setMode('manual')}>📝 Manual Input</button>
<button onClick={() => setMode('client')}>👤 Client Documents</button>
```

#### 2. Conditional Form Rendering
```typescript
{mode === 'manual' && (
  <div>
    <input name="debt" type="number" />
    <input name="income" type="number" />
    <input name="assets" type="number" />
  </div>
)}

{mode === 'client' && (
  <select name="client_id">
    {clients.map(c => <option value={c.client_id}>{c.name}</option>)}
  </select>
)}
```

#### 3. Smart Request Building
```typescript
const payload: EligibilityRequest = {
  question: formData.question,
  topic: formData.topic
};

if (mode === 'manual') {
  payload.debt = formData.debt;
  payload.income = formData.income;
  payload.assets = formData.assets;
} else {
  payload.client_id = formData.client_id;
}
```

## 📊 Data Flow Comparison

### Manual Mode Flow
```
User Input Form
  ↓
Question: "Can someone with £51k debt get a DRO?"
Debt: 51000
Income: 70
Assets: 1500
  ↓
POST /eligibility-check
  ↓
Backend uses values directly
  ↓
Decision Tree Evaluation
  ↓
Color-coded results
```

### Client Documents Mode Flow
```
User Input Form
  ↓
Question: "Is this client eligible for a DRO?"
Client: CLIENT123
  ↓
POST /eligibility-check
  ↓
Backend queries client's vectorstore
  ↓
Symbolic reasoning extracts:
  - debt: 51234 (from bank statement)
  - income: 68 (from payslip)
  - assets: 1450 (from asset list)
  ↓
Decision Tree Evaluation
  ↓
Same color-coded results
```

- ✅ Both modes: No LLM math errors

### Integration
- ✅ Works with "Ask the Manuals" tab (manual mode)
- ✅ Works with "Client Document Search" tab (client mode)
- ✅ Standalone component with mode selector

### User Experience
- ✅ Color-coded status (✅❌⚠️❓) for both modes
- ✅ Same response structure regardless of mode
- ✅ Clear indication of which mode is active

## 📝 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Advisor in Consultation (Manual Mode)
**Context**: Client on phone mentions £51k debt, £70 income, £1.5k assets

**Action**:
1. Switch to Manual mode
2. Enter question: "Can this client get a DRO?"
3. Type values: debt=51000, income=70, assets=1500
4. Click "Check Eligibility"

**Result**: Instant feedback showing near-miss opportunity (pay £1k to qualify)

---

### Scenario 2: Formal Assessment (Client Mode)
**Context**: Client uploaded bank statements and payslips

**Action**:
1. Switch to Client mode
2. Select "John Smith (CLIENT123)" from dropdown
3. Enter question: "Is this client eligible for a DRO?"
4. Click "Check Eligibility"

**Result**: 
- Values extracted from documents: debt=£51,234, income=£68, assets=£1,450
- Same color-coded eligibility assessment
- Recommendation: Pay £1,234 to qualify

---

### Scenario 3: Comparison (Manual Mode)
**Context**: Advisor wants to compare DRO vs Bankruptcy for same values

**Action**:
1. Stay in Manual mode
2. First query: topic="dro_eligibility", debt=51000
3. Second query: topic="bankruptcy_eligibility", debt=51000

**Result**: Side-by-side comparison showing which solution fits better

## 🧪 Testing Both Modes

### Test 1: Manual Mode (Near-Miss)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8102/eligibility-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Can someone with £51k debt get a DRO?",
    "debt": 51000,
    "income": 70,
    "assets": 1500,
    "topic": "dro_eligibility"
  }'
```

**Expected Result**:
- overall_result: "requires_review"
- debt: "near_miss" (gap: 1000)
- income: "eligible"
- assets: "eligible"
- recommendation: "Pay £1k to qualify"

---

### Test 2: Client Mode (Document Extraction)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8102/eligibility-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Is this client eligible for a DRO?",
    "client_id": "CLIENT123",
    "topic": "dro_eligibility"
  }'
```

**Expected Result**:
- Values extracted from client documents
- Same structure as manual mode
- Color-coded status indicators
- Near-miss detection and recommendations
