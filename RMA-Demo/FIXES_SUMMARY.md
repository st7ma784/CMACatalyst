# Fixes Summary - CORS & Repayment Calculator

## 1. CORS Issue (FIXED ✅)

### Problem
Browser requests to backend services at `http://192.168.5.70:8102` and `http://192.168.5.70:8103` were failing with:
```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: CORS request did not succeed. Status code: (null)
```

### Root Cause
**NOT a CORS configuration issue** - the services had CORS properly configured. The real issue was **Docker rootless networking** preventing external IP access to services.

- ✅ Services accessible on `localhost:8102/8103`
- ❌ Services NOT accessible on `192.168.5.70:8102/8103`

### Solution
Implemented **Next.js API proxy** to route browser requests through the frontend container:
- Created `/frontend/src/app/api/rag/[...path]/route.ts`
- Created `/frontend/src/app/api/upload/[...path]/route.ts`
- Created `/frontend/src/lib/apiUrls.ts` for centralized URL management
- Updated components to use proxy URLs

**Request flow**:
```
Browser → http://192.168.5.70:3000/api/rag/query
         → Next.js (running in Docker)
         → http://rag-service:8102/query (internal Docker network)
```

### Files Modified
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated port bindings
- `frontend/next.config.js` - Added rewrite rules
- `frontend/src/lib/apiUrls.ts` - NEW
- `frontend/src/app/api/rag/[...path]/route.ts` - NEW
- `frontend/src/app/api/upload/[...path]/route.ts` - NEW
- `frontend/src/components/AskTheManuals.tsx` - Updated URLs
- `frontend/src/app/advisor-dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated URLs
- `diagnose-cors.sh` - NEW diagnostic tool

## 2. Repayment Calculator Issues (FIXED ✅)

### Problem 1: Number Format Recognition
**Issue**: Terms like "61k" not being parsed correctly by symbolic logic.

**Example**:
- Input: "Client has 61k in debts"
- Previous: Not recognized → calculations fail
- Now: Correctly parsed as £61,000

### Problem 2: Incorrect Math
**Issue**: Repayment calculations fundamentally wrong.

**Example**:
```
Debt: £10,000
Monthly payment: £500

WRONG: (£10,000 / £500) / 12 ≈ 2.08 years
RIGHT: (£10,000 / £500) = 20 months = 1.67 years
```

### Solution
Created comprehensive **Repayment Calculator MCP Tool** at `services/mcp-server/repayment_calculator.py`.

#### Features

1. **Robust Number Parsing**
   ```python
   "61k" → £61,000
   "£10,000" → £10,000
   "$5,000" → £5,000
   "2.5m" → £2,500,000
   ```

2. **Four Calculation Types**:
   - `calculate_time_to_repay` - How long to pay off?
   - `calculate_monthly_payment` - How much per month?
   - `calculate_surplus_scenarios` - 100%/75%/50% allocation strategies
   - `compare_debt_solutions` - DRO/IVA/Bankruptcy comparison

3. **Interest Support**
   - Accurate amortization formulas
   - Month-by-month schedules
   - Total interest calculations

4. **Safety Features**
   - Payment validation (detects if payment < interest)
   - Iteration limits (prevents infinite loops)
   - Decimal precision (accurate financial math)

### Test Results

From `test_repayment_calculator.py`:

```
ISSUE 1: Number Format Recognition
  61k             → £61,000.00  ✅
  £10,000         → £10,000.00  ✅
  $5,000          → £5,000.00   ✅
  2.5m            → £2,500,000.00  ✅

ISSUE 2: Incorrect Math
  WRONG: (£10,000 / £500) / 12 ≈ 2.08 years  ❌
  RIGHT: £10,000 / £500 = 20 months = 1.67 years  ✅

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
  Client with 61k debt, £500/month payment:
  - Time: 122 months (10.17 years)  ✅ CORRECT
  - With 18.9% interest: Warns "payment < interest"  ✅ SMART
```

### Files Created
- `services/mcp-server/repayment_calculator.py` - Main calculator
- `services/mcp-server/server.py` - Updated with 4 new MCP tools
- `services/mcp-server/requirements.txt` - Added python-dateutil
- `test_repayment_calculator.py` - Comprehensive tests
- `REPAYMENT_CALCULATOR_GUIDE.md` - Full documentation

## Testing

### Test CORS Fix
```bash
# Should now work from browser at http://192.168.5.70:3000
curl http://localhost:3000/api/rag/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/upload/health
```

### Test Repayment Calculator
```bash
python3 test_repayment_calculator.py
# All tests pass ✅
```

### Test MCP Tools
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8105/mcp/tools/execute \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-key-change-in-production" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tool_name": "calculate_time_to_repay",
    "arguments": {
      "debt_amount": "61k",
      "monthly_payment": "£500"
    }
  }'
```

## Deployment Status

### Completed ✅
1. CORS fix implemented in Next.js
2. Repayment calculator created
3. MCP server updated with 4 new tools
4. Frontend rebuilt and restarted
5. MCP server rebuilt and restarted
6. Comprehensive tests created and passing

### Pending (Optional)
1. Integrate repayment calculator into RAG service's agent graph
2. Update existing numerical_tools.py to use MCP calculator
3. Add repayment calculator to LangGraph tools

## Next Steps

### For "Ask the Manuals" Integration

Update the RAG service to use the MCP repayment calculator:

```python
# In services/rag-service/numerical_tools.py or agent_graph.py
import requests

MCP_SERVER_URL = os.getenv("MCP_SERVER_URL", "http://mcp-server:8105")
MCP_API_KEY = os.getenv("MCP_API_KEY", "dev-key-change-in-production")

def calculate_repayment(debt: str, payment: str):
    """Use MCP repayment calculator for accurate math."""
    response = requests.post(
        f"{MCP_SERVER_URL}/mcp/tools/execute",
        json={
            "tool_name": "calculate_time_to_repay",
            "arguments": {
                "debt_amount": debt,
                "monthly_payment": payment,
                "annual_interest_rate": 0.0
            }
        },
        headers={"X-API-Key": MCP_API_KEY}
    )
    return response.json()["result"]
```

### Testing in Production

1. Navigate to `http://192.168.5.70:3000`
2. Go to "Ask the Manuals"
3. Ask: "If I have 61k debt and can pay £500 per month, how long to clear it?"
4. Response should show: **122 months (10.17 years)** ✅
