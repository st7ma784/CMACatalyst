   and council tax (£Y). Recommended approach based on FCA guidelines: [linked procedures].
   Similar successful case: [precedent example]"
   ```

2. **📚 Precedent Case Lookup**
   ```
   Search: "Mortgage arrears with high debt burden"
   Results: 5 similar cases with successful DMP outcomes,
   average debt reduction £15,000, 85% success rate
   ```

3. **🔗 Automatic Training Manual Linking**
   ```
   Note mentions: "mortgage arrears"
   System automatically links: "FCA Mortgage Conduct Rules Section 13.3.2",
   "Priority Debt Procedures Guide", "Vulnerable Customer Guidance"
   ```

4. **⚡ Real-time N8N Automation**
