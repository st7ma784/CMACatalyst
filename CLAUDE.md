Hi Claude, 

I want you to begin writing tests and packaging for the MordecAI advisor tool.

Add automated building into docker for each microservice. 

Make sure each service and our backend has unit tests with full coverage. 

Then test the Unity of the services by testing front-end functionality with playwright tests

Finally, make sure GH actions runs all these tests. (skip anything requiring LLMs until we have a self-hosted runner with GPUs)

We also need to add in dependabot tools.
