Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. This approach allows AI systems to access and utilize specific information from a knowledge base when generating responses.

Key Components of RAG:

1. Vector Store
The vector store holds document embeddings that represent the semantic meaning of text chunks. Popular vector databases include ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS.

2. Embeddings Model
An embeddings model converts text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. These vectors allow for efficient similarity search across documents.

3. Language Model
The language model (like Llama, GPT, or others) generates responses based on both the user's query and the retrieved context from the vector store.

4. Retrieval Mechanism
When a query is received, the system:
- Converts the query to a vector embedding
- Searches the vector store for similar content
- Retrieves the most relevant document chunks
- Provides this context to the language model
- Generates a response based on the retrieved information

Benefits of RAG:

- Up-to-date Information: Unlike traditional LLMs limited by training cutoff dates, RAG systems can access current information from your documents.

- Domain-Specific Knowledge: RAG allows LLMs to answer questions about proprietary or specialized information not present in their training data.

- Reduced Hallucinations: By grounding responses in retrieved documents, RAG reduces the likelihood of the model generating false or misleading information.

- Source Attribution: RAG systems can provide references to the source documents used to generate responses.

- Cost-Effective: RAG is more economical than fine-tuning models, especially for frequently changing information.

Use Cases:

- Customer support systems with access to product documentation
- Research assistants for scientific literature
- Legal document analysis
- Technical documentation helpers
- Internal knowledge base assistants

This demonstration uses Ollama for the language model, ChromaDB for vector storage, and implements RAG to answer questions based on your document collection.
