Hi Claude, 

I want you to check and add some functionality to the MordecAI money advisor tool. 

The client tab should have the following sub-tabs 
- Overview 
- Case Details 
- Compliance /Checklists
- Case Notes
- Client/ Household details
- Caseworkers
- Money - should have further areas for entering income, expenditure (each with enough detail to build SFS) Debts, savings, assets, FinancialStatement, DRO fact finder and creditors. 
- Letters - should enable advisors to generate custom letters to /on behalf of the client 
- Files - a store of every scanned or generated document for that case. (should also show anything from RabbitMQ for easy upload!)


Please ensure all that functionality exists within the client case interface.
