Julian Mander - Personal Profile

About Julian Mander

Julian Mander is an enthusiastic individual with diverse interests that shape his daily life and leisure activities. He has a particular fondness for British science fiction, especially the long-running television series Doctor Who. Julian has been a devoted Whovian since childhood, following the adventures of various Doctors across time and space. His favorite Doctor is the Tenth Doctor, portrayed by David Tennant, though he also has a soft spot for the Fourth Doctor's iconic scarf and the Thirteenth Doctor's optimistic energy.

Hobbies and Interests

Doctor Who Fandom:
Julian's love for Doctor Who extends beyond just watching episodes. He collects vintage Doctor Who merchandise, including action figures, DVDs, and replica props. His most prized possession is a signed photograph from a Doctor Who convention he attended in Cardiff. Julian enjoys discussing theories about the show's mythology, particularly concerning the Time Lords and the mysterious history of Gallifrey.

Railway Enthusiasm:
Julian is also an avid train enthusiast, or "railway buff" as he likes to call himself. He spends many weekends photographing trains at various stations and level crossings across the UK. His particular interest lies in steam locomotives, and he's a member of several heritage railway societies. Julian volunteers occasionally at a local heritage railway, where he helps with track maintenance and special event days. He has an extensive collection of train timetables dating back to the 1960s and can often be found poring over railway maps, planning his next railway photography expedition.

Recent Holiday Adventure

This past summer, Julian embarked on what he described as "the perfect holiday" - a railway journey through the Scottish Highlands combined with a visit to Doctor Who filming locations. 

The trip began in Edinburgh, where Julian stayed for two nights exploring the Royal Mile and sampling local cuisine. From there, he boarded the famous Caledonian Sleeper, the overnight train service to Inverness. Julian was thrilled with the experience of sleeping on a moving train, watching the Scottish countryside pass by his window as dawn broke over the mountains.

In Inverness, Julian spent three days exploring the Highland Main Line and visiting the nearby heritage railways. He took countless photographs of trains against the backdrop of Scotland's stunning mountain scenery. One particular highlight was riding the Strathspey Railway, a heritage line running through the Cairngorms National Park. The steam locomotive journey reminded him of the romance of classic British railway travel.

The final leg of Julian's holiday took him to Glasgow, where he spent two days visiting locations used in Doctor Who filming. He walked through the streets where various scenes were shot, visited the Glasgow Science Centre (which had appeared in several episodes), and even found the exact spot where a pivotal scene from the episode "World Enough and Time" was filmed. He documented everything with photographs and detailed notes, creating what he calls his "Doctor Who and Steam Dreams" scrapbook.

Julian returned home exhausted but exhilarated, already planning his next adventure. He's considering a trip to North Wales to visit the Ffestiniog Railway, one of the world's oldest narrow-gauge railways, potentially combining it with a visit to some Doctor Who locations in Cardiff and the surrounding areas.

Personal Philosophy

Julian believes that hobbies like watching Doctor Who and exploring railways aren't just pastimes - they're ways to connect with history, technology, and the stories that shape our culture. He often says, "Doctor Who teaches us about the infinite possibilities of the universe, while trains remind us of human engineering brilliance and our connection to the places we call home."

Julian's enthusiasm is infectious, and he loves sharing his passions with others, whether introducing friends to classic Doctor Who episodes or organizing group trips to heritage railways. His combination of interests makes him a fascinating conversationalist, able to draw connections between time travel adventures and the golden age of steam locomotives with equal enthusiasm.
