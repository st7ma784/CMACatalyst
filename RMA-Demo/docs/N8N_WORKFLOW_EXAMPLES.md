## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Creating Workflows

### Start Simple
1. **One trigger, one action**
   - Get it working first
   - Add complexity later

2. **Test each node individually**
   - Execute node button
   - Check output
   - Verify before continuing

3. **Use descriptive names**
   - "Send Welcome Email" âœ“
   - "HTTP Request 1" âœ—

### Add Error Handling

```
Main Workflow
     â†“
   [Try]
     â†“
  IF Error?
   â”œâ†’ [Yes] â†’ Send Error Alert â†’ Log â†’ Stop
   â””â†’ [No] â†’ Continue
```

### Use Expressions Wisely

```javascript
// Good: Clear and maintainable
{{ $json.client_name }}

// Bad: Complex nested logic
{{ $json.clients[0].details.name.split(' ')[0] }}
```

### Document Your Workflows

Add notes to complex nodes:
- Why this step is needed
- What data format expected
- Common issues and solutions
