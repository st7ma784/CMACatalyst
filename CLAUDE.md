Hi Claude, 

This repo and software lean heavily on automated workflows. Can you review the centre manager roles and ability to set up ai flows. Can you plan out some useful n8n workflows and add this integration to the dashboard, it might be that really, this should be spun up separately, and we jsut have some good MCP plugins for specific client files, and wider statistics / centre calendar info. Can you implement these MCP points first, and then look at if there's a good way to enable the centre manager to implement these n8n flows. Bare in mind they wont have the same expertise you do, so simple, explaining steps is very important here.
