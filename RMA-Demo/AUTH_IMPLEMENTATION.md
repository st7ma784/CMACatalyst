# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented authentication for all advisor-facing features while keeping client-facing features public.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Context (`/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Created global auth context to manage login state
- Handles token storage in localStorage
- Auto-redirects unauthenticated users to login
- Allows public routes: `/advisor-login` and `/client-upload/*`

### 2. Root Layout (`/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Wrapped app with AuthProvider for global auth state

### 3. Main Dashboard (`/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`)
**Protected - Requires Auth**
- Checks authentication on mount
- Shows loading state while checking
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Displays username and logout button
- Provides access to:
  - Notes to CoA conversion
  - QR Code generation
  - Client document search
  - Ask the Manuals
  - Documentation

### 4. Advisor Login (`/frontend/src/app/advisor-login/page.tsx`)
**Public Route**
- Uses auth context `login()` function
- Redirects to main dashboard on success
- Shows default credentials (admin/admin123)

### 5. Advisor Dashboard (`/frontend/src/app/advisor-dashboard/page.tsx`)
**Protected - Requires Auth**
- Lists all clients with uploaded documents
- Uses `/clients` API endpoint
- Download files with authentication
- Shows document metadata

### 6. Client Upload Page (`/frontend/src/app/client-upload/[clientId]/page.tsx`)
**PUBLIC - No Auth Required**
- Accessible via QR code
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Shows upload progress
- No login required for clients

### 7. QR Code Generator Component
- Tracks generated client IDs in localStorage
- Updated to use public client upload URLs

### 8. Upload Service API Changes (`/services/upload-service/app.py`)

**New Endpoint:**
- `GET /clients` - Lists all clients (requires auth)

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `POST /generate-qr` - Points to `/client-upload/{client_id}` (requires auth)
- `POST /uploads/{client_id}` - **NO AUTH REQUIRED** (public for clients)
- `POST /triage-document` - **NO AUTH REQUIRED** (public for "Should I worry?" button)

**Modified Fields:**
- `uploaded_by` changed from `username` to `"client"` for public uploads

## Authentication Flow

### Advisor Flow
1. Visit any protected page → Redirected to `/advisor-login`
2. Login with credentials (admin/admin123)
3. Access main dashboard with all features
4. Generate QR codes for clients
5. View uploaded client documents in `/advisor-dashboard`
6. Logout clears tokens and redirects to login

### Client Flow
1. Scan QR code → `/client-upload/{clientId}`
2. Upload documents (no authentication)
3. Files automatically processed
4. Advisor can view in their dashboard

## Protected Features (Require Auth)
✅ Main Dashboard (/)
✅ Notes to CoA
✅ QR Code Generator
✅ Client Document Search
✅ Ask the Manuals
✅ Documentation
✅ Advisor Dashboard
✅ View Client Uploads API
✅ Download Client Documents API
✅ Generate QR API

## Public Features (No Auth)
✅ Client Upload Page (`/client-upload/{clientId}`)
✅ Upload Document API (`POST /uploads/{clientId}`)
✅ Triage Document API (`POST /triage-document`)
✅ Login Page (`/advisor-login`)

## Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- Tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token verification on API calls
- Protected routes redirect to login
- Public routes accessible without login
- Logout clears all auth data

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials fails
- [ ] Protected pages redirect when not logged in
- [ ] Client upload works without authentication
- [ ] QR codes point to public upload URL
- [ ] Advisor can view all client uploads
- [ ] Advisor can download files
- [ ] Triage endpoint works without auth
- [ ] Logout clears session and redirects

## Next Steps
1. Rebuild frontend and upload service containers
2. Test login flow end-to-end
3. Verify client upload works without auth
4. Test QR code generation and scanning
5. Verify advisor dashboard shows client files

## Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `JWT_SECRET` - Already configured in `.env`
- `UPLOAD_SERVICE_URL` - Frontend API endpoint
- `APP_BASE_URL` - Base URL for QR codes (defaults to http://localhost:3000)
