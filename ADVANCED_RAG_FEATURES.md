# Advanced RAG Features Guide

This guide covers the advanced RAG features implemented in the CMA Catalyst system, including case notes enhancement, precedent lookup, and intelligent workflow automation.

## üöÄ Advanced Features Overview

### 1. **Case Notes Enhancement System**
Automatically improves case notes quality through AI analysis and training manual integration.

### 2. **Case Precedent Lookup**
Searches through closed cases to find similar situations and successful resolutions.

### 3. **Intelligent N8N Workflows**
Automated workflows that trigger on case note changes and provide intelligent enhancements.

### 4. **Multi-Collection Vector Search**
Searches across training manuals, case precedents, and enhanced notes simultaneously.

## üîß Case Notes Enhancement System

### How It Works

When a case note is created or updated, the system:
1. **Triggers N8N workflow** for automatic analysis
2. **Searches training manuals** for relevant guidance
3. **Finds similar cases** from historical data
4. **Identifies compliance requirements** from FCA guidelines
5. **Generates enhanced note** with AI suggestions
6. **Links training materials** for future reference

### Implementation

#### API Endpoints

```javascript
// Create enhanced case note
POST /api/case-notes/create
{
  "case_id": "case_123",
  "note_content": "Client has multiple priority debts...",
  "note_type": "assessment",
  "advisor_id": "advisor_456",
  "client_situation": "mortgage arrears and utility debts"
}

// Update existing note with enhancement
PUT /api/case-notes/update
{
  "note_id": "note_789",
  "note_content": "Updated assessment after client meeting...",
  "changes_summary": "Added income verification details"
}

// Finalize enhanced note and add to knowledge base
POST /api/case-notes/finalize
{
  "note_id": "note_789",
  "final_content": "Enhanced note with AI improvements...",
  "training_links": [
    {
      "source": "FCA Mortgage Arrears Guide",
      "section": "Priority Debt Assessment",
      "relevance_score": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

#### N8N Workflow Integration

The case note review workflow (`case-note-review-enhancement.json`) automatically:

1. **Validates note data** and extracts key information
2. **Searches multiple collections** in parallel:
   - Training materials for procedural guidance
   - Similar cases for precedent examples
   - Compliance requirements for regulatory alignment
3. **Generates enhanced version** using AI with contextual prompts
4. **Structures enhancement data** with training links and suggestions
5. **Returns comprehensive review** for advisor approval

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Note Enhancement
```javascript
// JavaScript client code
const enhanceNote = async (noteData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/case-notes/create', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      case_id: noteData.caseId,
      note_content: noteData.content,
      note_type: 'assessment',
      advisor_id: getCurrentAdvisorId(),
      client_situation: noteData.clientSituation
    })
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  console.log('Enhancement started:', result.note_id);

  // Monitor enhancement progress via WebSocket or polling
  return result;
};
```

#### Integration with Existing Forms
```javascript
// Form submission handler
document.getElementById('case-note-form').addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  const formData = new FormData(e.target);
  const noteData = {
    caseId: formData.get('case_id'),
    content: formData.get('note_content'),
    clientSituation: formData.get('client_situation')
  };

  // Trigger enhancement
  const enhancement = await enhanceNote(noteData);

  // Show enhancement status
  showEnhancementStatus(enhancement);
});
```

## üìö Case Precedent Lookup System

### Closed Case Ingestion

When cases are closed, they're automatically processed and added to the vector store:

```javascript
// Ingest closed case for future precedent lookup
POST /api/rag/cases/ingest/closed-case
{
  "case_id": "case_456",
  "case_data": {
    "case_type": "debt-management",
    "client_situation": "Multiple creditors, mortgage arrears",
    "total_debt": 45000,
    "monthly_income": 2500,
    "case_outcome": "successful",
    "recommended_solution": "Debt Management Plan",
    "advice_summary": "Prioritized mortgage payments, negotiated payment plans",
    "resolution_details": "All creditors agreed to reduced payments",
    "debt_reduction_achieved": 15000,
    "case_duration_days": 90,
    "success_rating": "high"
  }
}
```

### Similar Case Search

Find cases with similar characteristics:

```javascript
// Search for similar cases
POST /api/rag/cases/search/similar
{
  "query": "mortgage arrears multiple creditors high debt",
  "case_type": "debt-management",
  "outcome_filter": "successful",
  "top_k": 5,
  "score_threshold": 0.7
}

// Response includes similar cases with outcomes
{
  "similar_cases": [
    {
      "case_id": "case_789",
      "similarity_score": 0.89,
      "case_type": "debt-management",
      "case_outcome": "successful",
      "content_preview": "Client facing mortgage arrears of ¬£8,000...",
      "financial_summary": {
        "total_debt": 42000,
        "debt_reduction": 12000,
        "case_duration": 85
      },
      "success_rating": "high"
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 3
}
```

### Financial Profile Matching

Find cases with similar financial profiles:

```javascript
// Find cases with similar debt-to-income ratios
POST /api/rag/cases/search/by-financial-profile
{
  "total_debt": 45000,
  "monthly_income": 2500,
  "case_type": "debt-management",
  "top_k": 5
}
```

## üîç Multi-Collection Search

Search across all knowledge sources simultaneously:

```javascript
// Search training manuals
const trainingResults = await fetch('/api/rag/search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "mortgage arrears procedures",
    collection_name: "training_manuals",
    manual_type: "fca-guidelines"
  })
});

// Search case precedents
const precedentResults = await fetch('/api/rag/search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "mortgage arrears procedures",
    collection_name: "case_precedents",
    manual_type: "debt-management"
  })
});

// Search enhanced case notes
const notesResults = await fetch('/api/rag/search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "mortgage arrears procedures",
    collection_name: "case_notes",
    manual_type: "assessment"
  })
});
```

## ü§ñ Intelligent Workflow Automation

### Automatic Case Note Review

When notes are modified, N8N workflows automatically:

1. **Analyze content quality** against training standards
2. **Suggest improvements** based on similar successful cases
3. **Link relevant training materials** for advisor reference
4. **Check compliance requirements** against FCA guidelines
5. **Generate quality score** for continuous improvement

### Workflow Triggers

```javascript
// Trigger custom N8N workflow
POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/case-note-review
{
  "note_id": "note_123",
  "case_id": "case_456",
  "note_content": "Assessment notes...",
  "note_type": "assessment",
  "advisor_id": "advisor_789",
  "client_situation": "Multiple priority debts",
  "action": "create"
}
```

### Quality Assurance Integration

The system provides continuous quality monitoring:

```javascript
// Get quality metrics for notes
GET /api/case-notes/quality-metrics
{
  "advisor_id": "advisor_123",
  "date_range": "2024-01-01/2024-01-31"
}

// Response includes quality trends
{
  "average_quality_score": 0.82,
  "notes_enhanced": 45,
  "training_links_added": 127,
  "compliance_improvements": 23,
  "similar_cases_referenced": 67
}
```

## üìä Analytics and Insights
