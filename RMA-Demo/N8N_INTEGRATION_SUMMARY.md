## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. **Manual Compliance Checks**
Centre manager runs audit before submitting client application

### 2. **Scheduled Audits**
Every Monday morning, audit all active clients and email summary

### 3. **Upload Triggers**
When client uploads new document, re-run audit automatically

### 4. **Missing Document Alerts**
Daily check for clients missing required docs, send reminder emails

### 5. **Workflow Integration**
Connect to CRM, email, Slack, etc. for full automation

## üîß Customization

### Add Custom Checks

Edit the checklist in the workflow or API call:

```json
{
  "item": "DRO Debt Limit Check",
  "required": true,
  "query": "Based on the client documents, is the total debt under ¬£30,000?",
  "category": "eligibility"
}
```

### Categories

Organize checks by category:
- `financial` - Income, expenses, budgets
- `identity` - ID, proof of address
- `debt` - Creditor letters, statements
- `assets` - Property, vehicles
- `eligibility` - DRO/Bankruptcy criteria

### Strict Mode

Set `strict_mode: true` to fail immediately on first missing required document.
