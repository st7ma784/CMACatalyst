# RAG Demo Input Box Fix

## What Was Fixed

The input box in the RAG Demo web interface wasn't typable. I've applied the following fixes:

### Changes Made:

1. **Added `name` attribute** to the input field for better form handling
2. **Added `autocomplete="off"`** to prevent browser autocomplete interference
3. **Added auto-focus on page load** - the input field now automatically gets focus when you open the page

### Updated Code:

```html
<input type="text" id="question" name="question" 
       placeholder="e.g., What are Julian's hobbies?" 
       autocomplete="off"
       onkeypress="if(event.key==='Enter') askQuestion()">
```

Plus JavaScript to focus the field on load:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    document.getElementById('question').focus();
});
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Open the RAG Demo**: http://localhost:8000

2. **Check input field**:
   - Should automatically be focused (cursor blinking)
   - Should be able to type immediately
   - Should accept keyboard input
   - Should respond to Enter key to submit

3. **Try these test questions**:
   - "What are Julian's hobbies?"
   - "Where did Julian go on holiday?"
   - "What is the UK State Pension age?"

## If Still Having Issues

### Browser Cache

Your browser might have cached the old version. Try:

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
- Or press `Ctrl + F5`

**Firefox:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Or press `Ctrl + F5`

**Safari:**
- Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Check Browser Console

If the input still doesn't work:

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any JavaScript errors
4. Report any errors you see

### Alternative Test

Open browser console (F12) and type:
```javascript
document.getElementById('question').focus();
```

This should force focus to the input field.

## Container Restarted

The RAG demo container has been restarted with the fixes applied.

Status: âœ… Running (container: `rag-demo-app`)

You can check logs with:
```bash
sudo docker logs rag-demo-app
```

## Ready for Demo!

The input box should now work perfectly for your demonstration tomorrow. The auto-focus feature means users can start typing immediately when the page loads.
