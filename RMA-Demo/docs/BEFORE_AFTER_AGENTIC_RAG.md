RESPONSE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
To prioritize debts, you should consider which debts 
are priority debts. Priority debts include rent, 
mortgage, and council tax. Non-priority debts include 
credit cards and loans.

[STEP 1: ANALYZE COMPLEXITY] 🤔
  LLM Analysis:
  {
    "complexity": "complex",
    "reasoning": "Requires combining debt 
                  prioritization with breathing 
                  space rules",
    "suggested_searches": [
      "debt prioritization criteria",
      "breathing space eligibility", 
      "priority vs non-priority debts"
    ],
    "requires_synthesis": true
  }
  
       ↓

[STEP 2: PLAN STRATEGY] 📋
  Plan:
  - Iterations: 2 (moderate complexity)
  - Searches: 2 targeted queries
  - Top-K: 4 per search
  - Expected chunks: 6-8 unique
  
       ↓

[STEP 3: ITERATIVE SEARCH] 🔍
  
  Search 1: "debt prioritization criteria"
    → 4 chunks from CPAG 1
  
  Search 2: "breathing space eligibility"
    → 4 chunks from CPAG 5
    
  Deduplicate: 8 unique chunks from 2 sources
  
       ↓

[STEP 4: SYNTHESIZE] 💡
  Combine context from both topics:
  - Debt prioritization rules
  - Breathing space procedures
  - How they interact
  - Practical guidance

🤖 Agent Response | 🔄 2 iterations

To prioritize debts for a client with both priority and 
non-priority debts who wants breathing space, follow 
these steps:

1. IDENTIFY PRIORITY DEBTS
According to [Source 1: CPAG 1], priority debts are 
those where non-payment would give the creditor the 
right to deprive the client of their home, liberty, 
or essential services. These include:
- Rent/mortgage arrears
- Council tax
- Court fines
- Utilities (if disconnection threatened)

2. UNDERSTAND BREATHING SPACE COVERAGE
As stated in [Source 2: CPAG 5], the breathing space 
scheme provides 60 days protection from creditor 
action and applies to BOTH priority and non-priority 
debts. During this period:
- Enforcement action is paused
- Interest and charges are frozen
- Client has time to seek advice

3. PRIORITIZATION WITHIN BREATHING SPACE
Following [Source 1] procedures, even during breathing 
space, you should:
- Address priority debts first in any payment plan
- Use the breathing space period to negotiate with 
  priority creditors
- Develop a sustainable budget that covers priority 
  debts before addressing non-priority debts

🎯 Confidence: HIGH - Found comprehensive procedures 
in multiple sources that directly address this scenario.
