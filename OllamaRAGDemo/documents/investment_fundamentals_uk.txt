INVESTMENT FUNDAMENTALS FOR UK INVESTORS

Understanding Different Investment Types

Stocks and Shares
When you buy shares, you own a small part of a company. Share prices fluctuate based on company performance and market conditions. You can profit through capital growth (share price increase) and dividends (profit distributions).

Bonds
Bonds are loans to governments or companies. You receive regular interest payments and get your money back at maturity. Generally lower risk than shares but lower returns.

Funds
Pooled investments managed by professionals:
- Unit Trusts: Open-ended funds, price based on underlying assets
- OEICs (Open-Ended Investment Companies): Similar to unit trusts
- Investment Trusts: Closed-ended, traded on stock market
- ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds): Track indices, trade like shares

Property
Investing in residential or commercial property, either directly or through REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts).

Investment Accounts

General Investment Account (GIA): No tax benefits but no contribution limits. You pay tax on gains and income.

Stocks and Shares ISA: Tax-free gains and income. £20,000 annual limit.

Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP): Tax relief on contributions, tax-free growth, but can't access until 55 (rising to 57).

Risk and Return

Higher potential returns generally mean higher risk. Your risk tolerance depends on:
- Investment timeframe
- Financial situation
- Age
- Experience
- Personal comfort with volatility

Diversification

Don't put all eggs in one basket. Spread investments across:
- Different asset classes (shares, bonds, property)
- Geographic regions
- Industry sectors
- Individual companies

Costs and Fees

Platform fees: 0.25%-0.45% annually
Fund management fees: 0.1%-2% annually
Transaction costs: £5-£12 per trade typically
Stamp Duty: 0.5% on UK share purchases

Fees compound over time. A 1% fee difference can cost tens of thousands over decades.

Investment Strategies

Lump Sum Investing: Invest available money immediately. Historically performs better but psychologically harder.

Pound Cost Averaging: Invest regular amounts over time. Reduces timing risk and makes investing more manageable.

Value Investing: Buy undervalued companies trading below intrinsic value.

Growth Investing: Invest in companies expected to grow faster than market average.

Passive Investing: Track market indices through low-cost funds. Simple, cheap, effective for most investors.

Active Investing: Try to beat the market through stock selection or timing. Higher costs, most active managers underperform.

Investment Timeframes

Short-term (0-3 years): Cash, bonds. Preservation over growth.
Medium-term (3-10 years): Balanced portfolio of shares and bonds.
Long-term (10+ years): Higher equity allocation for growth potential.

Common Investment Mistakes

1. Timing the market - Time in the market beats timing the market
2. Emotional decisions - Don't panic sell during downturns
3. Overtrading - Excess fees erode returns
4. Insufficient diversification - Concentration risk
5. Ignoring costs - Fees compound negatively
6. Chasing performance - Past performance doesn't predict future
7. Not having a plan - Define goals and stick to strategy

Tax-Efficient Investing

Use allowances fully:
- ISA allowance (£20,000)
- Personal Savings Allowance (£1,000/£500)
- Dividend Allowance (£1,000)
- Capital Gains Allowance (£6,000)

Pension contributions receive tax relief up to £60,000 annually.

Bed and ISA: Sell investments in taxable account and repurchase in ISA to utilize allowances.

Consider Financial Advice

Independent Financial Advisers can provide personalized guidance. Fee structures vary - some charge fixed fees, others percentage of assets. Ensure they're FCA regulated.

For straightforward investing, robo-advisors offer algorithm-based portfolio management at lower costs than traditional advisers.

Risk Warning

Investments can go down as well as up. You may get back less than you invested. Past performance is not a guide to future returns. Consider seeking financial advice if unsure.
