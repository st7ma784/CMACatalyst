## üîë Key Concepts

### What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** - The system retrieves relevant information from training manuals before generating an answer.

**Example:**
```
Question: "What's the DRO debt limit?"
    ‚Üì
Search manuals for "DRO debt limit"
    ‚Üì
Find: "DRO maximum debt is ¬£50,000"
    ‚Üì
Generate answer: "The DRO debt limit is ¬£50,000..."
```

### What is LangGraph?

**Graph-based agent workflow** - Instead of a simple question-answer, the system uses multiple steps to reason about complex queries.

**Example:**
```
Question: "Am I eligible for a DRO?"
    ‚Üì
Step 1: Analyze question (complex, needs eligibility check)
    ‚Üì
Step 2: Retrieve client financial data
    ‚Üì
Step 3: Extract values (debt, income, assets)
    ‚Üì
Step 4: Load thresholds from manuals
    ‚Üì
Step 5: Compare symbolically (debt < ¬£50k? ‚úì)
    ‚Üì
Step 6: Generate answer with reasoning
```

### What is Symbolic Reasoning?

**Using Python math instead of LLM guessing** - For financial calculations, we use Python code to ensure accuracy.

**Why:**
- ‚úó LLM: "Is ¬£15,000 < ¬£50,000? Probably yes..."
- ‚úì Python: `15000 < 50000  # True` (always correct)

### What is n8n?

**Visual workflow automation** - Create automated processes by connecting blocks together (like LEGO).

**Example workflow:**
```
New client registers ‚Üí Send welcome email ‚Üí Create calendar appointment ‚Üí Notify adviser
```

No coding required!

### What are Thresholds?

**Financial limits extracted from manuals** - The system automatically finds limits like "DRO max debt: ¬£50,000" and uses them for eligibility checks.

**Benefits:**
- No hardcoded values
- Always up-to-date (update manual ‚Üí restart ‚Üí new thresholds)
- Source-traceable (know which manual it came from)

## üí° Common Questions

### Q: Can I use this system without technical knowledge?

**A:** Yes! The [n8n Centre Manager Guide](N8N_CENTRE_MANAGER_GUIDE.md) is written for non-technical users. You can:
- Create simple workflows with visual drag-and-drop
- Use pre-built templates from [Workflow Examples](N8N_WORKFLOW_EXAMPLES.md)
- Ask IT for help with complex tasks

### Q: How accurate is the eligibility checker?

**A:** Very accurate for straightforward cases. See [Test Results](../TEST_RESULTS_AGENTIC_RAG.md) for detailed accuracy metrics. The system uses:
- Symbolic reasoning (Python math, not LLM guessing)
- Thresholds from official manuals (not hallucinated)
- Confidence scores (tells you when it's unsure)

**Important:** Always have a qualified adviser review eligibility decisions.

### Q: What data does the system store?

**A:**
- **General RAG**: Training manual content (no personal data)
- **Client RAG**: Client-uploaded documents (separated per client)
- **n8n**: Workflow configurations and execution logs

See [n8n Centre Manager Guide](N8N_CENTRE_MANAGER_GUIDE.md) - "Security & Privacy" section.

### Q: Can I add my own training manuals?

**A:** Yes! See [Manuals Directory Guide](../manuals/README.md) for:
- What formats are supported (PDF)
- How to add manuals
- How to verify they're indexed
- Copyright considerations

### Q: What if n8n stops working?

**A:** See [n8n Troubleshooting Guide](N8N_TROUBLESHOOTING.md):
1. Quick diagnosis (is n8n running?)
2. 10 common problems with solutions
3. When to call IT
4. Health check procedures

### Q: Can I modify the workflows?

**A:** Absolutely! That's the point. See [n8n Workflow Examples](N8N_WORKFLOW_EXAMPLES.md) for:
- Templates to start from
- Best practices for modifications
- Testing before activating
- Version control tips

### Q: How do I know if the system is working correctly?

**A:** Multiple checks:
1. **For n8n**: Check Executions tab for green checkmarks
2. **For RAG**: Ask a test question with known answer
3. **For thresholds**: Query `/thresholds` endpoint
4. **Full system**: See [Agentic RAG Deployment Success](../AGENTIC_RAG_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md)

### Q: What's the difference between the two RAG services?

**A:** See [Dual Mode Architecture](../DUAL_MODE_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md):
- **Main RAG Service** (port 8102): General debt advice questions, searches training manuals
- **Client RAG Service** (port 8104): Client-specific questions, searches client's uploaded documents

Both now use LangGraph agents!
