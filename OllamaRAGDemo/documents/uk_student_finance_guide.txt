Interest Rates

While studying: RPI + 3%
After graduating: RPI to RPI + 3% depending on income

Currently high due to inflation, but remember: most won't repay full amount, so high interest less impactful than seems.

Should You Repay Early?

For most: No. Treat as graduate tax rather than debt.

Consider early repayment only if:

- Debt causes significant mental stress
- Planning to move abroad permanently

Don't repay early if:
- Moderate earner unlikely to repay in full
- Have higher-interest debts
- Haven't built emergency fund
- Could use money for better investments

Conclusion

Focus on getting good degree and developing skills - long-term earning potential matters more than loan balance for most graduates.
