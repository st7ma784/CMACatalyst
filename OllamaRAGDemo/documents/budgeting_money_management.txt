The 50/30/20 Rule

Simple budgeting framework:
- 50% Needs (essential living costs)
- 30% Wants (discretionary spending)
- 20% Savings and debt repayment

Adjust percentages based on circumstances - high rent areas may need 60/20/20, etc.

Budgeting Methods

Envelope Method: Allocate cash to envelopes for each category. When empty, stop spending.

Zero-Based Budget: Every pound has a job. Income minus all allocations (including savings) = zero.

Pay Yourself First: Transfer savings on payday before spending on anything else.

Budgeting Apps

Free apps track spending automatically:
- Money Dashboard
- Snoop
- Emma
- Plum

Bank apps increasingly include spending analysis and budgeting tools.

Reducing Expenses

Housing: Consider lodger, downsize, remortgage for better rate.
Utilities: Switch providers annually, reduce usage, insulate home.
Food: Meal plan, buy own-brand, reduce takeaways, batch cook.
Transport: Car share, cycle, use public transport, maintain vehicle properly.
Subscriptions: Cancel unused services, share accounts where allowed.
Insurance: Compare prices, increase excess, bundle policies.
Phone: SIM-only deals cheaper than contracts, consider switching.

Increasing Income

Side hustles: Freelancing, selling items, gig economy work.
Career development: Training, qualifications, asking for raise.
Benefits: Ensure claiming all entitled benefits.
Tax: Check tax code correct, claim allowances.

Building Emergency Fund

Start with £1,000, build to 3-6 months expenses.
Keep in easy access savings account.
Prevents debt when unexpected costs arise.

Managing Irregular Expenses

Annual costs (insurance, subscriptions, car tax) cause budget problems if unprepared.

Calculate annual irregular expenses, divide by 12, save monthly.

Example: £600 car insurance + £360 Amazon Prime + £180 car tax = £1,140 annually = £95 monthly

Dealing with Financial Stress

Talk to someone - partner, friend, debt charity.
Face the numbers - avoiding makes it worse.
Take action - even small steps help.
Seek professional help if needed.

Money Saving Tips

Walk instead of drive for short trips.
Library instead of buying books.
Packed lunch instead of buying.
Home-cooked meals instead of restaurants.
Own-brand products instead of brands.
Wait 24 hours before non-essential purchases.

Teaching Children About Money

Let them make small mistakes now to avoid big mistakes later.
Involve in family budget discussions (age-appropriate).
Encourage saving for goals.

Financial Goals

Set SMART goals:
Specific: Clear target (save £5,000)

Relevant: Meaningful to you
Time-bound: Set deadline

Review Progress

Monthly budget reviews catch problems early.
Adjust budget as circumstances change.

Conclusion

Budgeting isn't restrictive - it's liberating. Knowing where money goes allows conscious decisions. Even small changes compound significantly over time. Start today, adjust as you go, be patient with yourself.
