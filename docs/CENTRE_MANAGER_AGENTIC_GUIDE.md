# Centre Manager Agentic Workflows Guide

This guide explains how centre managers can use AI-powered agentic workflows to automate routine tasks while maintaining complete control and data privacy.

## What Are Agentic Workflows?

Agentic workflows are AI-powered automation systems that can perform complex, multi-step management tasks autonomously. They use locally hosted AI models to analyze your centre data, generate insights, and create professional outputs - all without sending any data outside your infrastructure.

## Key Principles

### üîí Complete Data Privacy
- **All AI processing happens on your servers** - no client data leaves your centre
- **Local AI models only** - Microsoft DialoGPT, Helsinki-NLP translation models, local analytics
- **No external API dependencies** for core functionality
- **Full audit trail** of all AI operations and decisions

### üß† AI-Assisted, Human-Supervised
- **AI handles routine analysis and document generation**
- **Managers review and approve all outputs** before use
- **Clear explanations** of what the AI did and why
- **Override capabilities** for all AI recommendations

### ‚ö° Massive Time Savings
- **Monthly reports**: 4-6 hours ‚Üí 10 minutes
- **Staff workload analysis**: 2-3 hours ‚Üí 5 minutes  
- **Priority case reviews**: 1-2 hours ‚Üí 2 minutes
